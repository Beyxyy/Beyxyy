Hello, Iâ€™m Anthony!

I graduated with a BUT MMI (Multimedia and Internet Jobs) degree in 2023 from Mulhouse (France), and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at ENSISA (National School of Engineering).
What are my key strengths?

    Development: I am passionate about developing new software and web applications (mainly in JavaScript/TypeScript) just for fun and to keep learning new things.
    CI/CD: Recently, I discovered Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), which complements development, testing, and hosting. I am currently exploring tools and technologies like GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

ðŸŽ“ I am actively looking for an internship, so feel free to contact me at: anthony.kalbe@uha.fr.

I have a lot to bring to your company, and I would be thrilled to contribute to your projects.
Thank you for taking the time to explore my workâ€”I hope you enjoy discovering my projects!
